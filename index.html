      <div class="columnContainer">
        <p>In this day and age of surveillance and spying, why would we assume that our government would protect its citizens? Instead, for the past 35 years the government has been lying to us and using drones disguised as birds to watch our every move.
        Only recently has a small community been brave enough to reveal the best kept secret in United States History. Join the movement and make the government tell us the truth once and for all.</p>
